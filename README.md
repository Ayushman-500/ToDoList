# ToDoList
I learned to build this web application in [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course. <br />

This web application provides a ToDoList where one can add and delete items and can do so for multiple such lists of different categories. 

In order to create a new category just add (/<category_name>) to the url. For example, in order to add "home" category, this URL - https://todolist-lvsb.onrender.com will convert to https://todolist-lvsb.onrender.com/home.

This web applicatoin is deployed on Heroku and the data is persisted using MongoDB Atlas.
